# About
As a preliminary step, this site allows for visual, interactive exploration of X stylistic elements. 
The underlying data and code can be used to facilitate direct comparison with other early modern text. 
The patterns for Il Saggiatore can facilitate close reading and interpretation of individual sections or the work as a whole. 
The list below indicates a few questions that can be answered with the current visualizations, but the project is designed to be extensible so that more texts and contexts can be analyzed and compared.
